# Introduction to Kubernetes Static Analysis Tools

Kubernetes has become the leading framework for container orchestration. For those who use Kubernetes to manage their application workloads, it is essential to understand the importance of Kubernetes manifests, which serve as the foundation of the cluster. As misconfigurations in these manifests can introduce vulnerabilities, it is crucial to conduct a static code analysis of the YAML-based Kubernetes manifests prior to deployment. Despite this, some Kubernetes production deployments still experience configuration issues and security threats post-deployment.

This article will explore five different Kubernetes static code analysis alternatives you can use to scan, analyze, and recommend best practices to create a secure and stable Kubernetes environment.
